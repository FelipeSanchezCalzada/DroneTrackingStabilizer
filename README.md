# DroneTracking Stabilizer

DroneTracking Stabilizer is a proof of concept of a drone stabilization system that does not support another type of stabilization, for example small drones without GPS.
The main idea is to provide several cameras with the enclosure where the drone is flown and the position is controlled externally.
